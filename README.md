# This project is a fully responsive React.js application for browsing, filtering, and sorting company data. It was developed as part of a frontend assignment to demonstrate skills in React, API integration, state management, and UI design using Bootstrap.

# The application loads company data from a mock API (companies.json) and allows users to:

# Filter companies by Name, Industry, or Location

# Search dynamically as the user types

# Sort companies by Name (Ascending / Descending)

# View a responsive layout that adapts to large, medium, and small screens

# Browse company details in a clean table format

# Visit company websites through action buttons

# The UI is built entirely with Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap Icons, ensuring smooth responsiveness and alignment across devices. Filtering and sorting are implemented using React hooks and computed via useMemo for optimized performance.
